# python-exercism
Completed exercises from Exercism.io. I did this as practice to keep my python skills sharp.

## What I learned
I loved the do it yourself approach where you had to self-learn sometimes to solve problems. The community solutions were also very helpful: sometimes my solutions were unique and very efficient, and sometimes a community memeber's solution taught me a whole new way of looking at the problem.
